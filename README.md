# 📊 SkillSignal: A Multi-Signal Readiness Framework for Enablement

This project simulates a real-world enablement pipeline that combines multiple learner signals to compute readiness scores and classify technical field team members into actionable categories.

Built using Databricks (Spark + Delta + SQL), this project demonstrates:
- Multi-signal validation modeling
- Data engineering in PySpark
- Delta Lake integration
- Readiness scoring and classification
- SQL-based dashboards for insights

## 🚀 Features
- 6 learning signals: attendance, assessment, labs, peer review, self-confidence, engagement
- Weighted readiness scoring
- Readiness status labels: Ready, Needs Support, At Risk
- Saved as Delta Table and queried via SQL
- Visualized as bar/pie charts

## 📁 Files
- `SkillSignal_Readiness_Scoring.ipynb`: Full notebook
- `SkillSignal_Readiness_Scoring.html`: Preview version
